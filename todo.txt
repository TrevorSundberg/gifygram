DONE - Refactored into classes
DONE - Make it so we can add sprites
DONE - Need a data structure to keep track of all the sprites and the video
DONE - Create editable text
DONE - Remove focus highlight
DONE - Savable and loadable format
DONE - Use a regex to parse the transform instead of a matrix, because it can't do multiple rotations!
DONE - Need to make the widgets as if they are inside the video, and need to scale the video to the min dimension of the screen
DONE - Code that copies a frame of the video so that the html2canvas code works
DONE - Get canvas rendering because we know it's all consistent
DONE - Get the text working with the animations, maybe need an animation event again like we had before (set value)
